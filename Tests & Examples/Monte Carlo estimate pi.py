### Using a 2D grid, a square with side length r, and circle with radius r
### Randomly place marbles into grid, if inside a shape, increment shape counter
### pi = circle count / square count

### Explaination: square area = r^2, Circle area = pi x r^2

### therefore as placement is random the number of marbles in the circle is equal to
### the number of marbles in the square times pi 


squareCounter = 0
circleCounter = 0
